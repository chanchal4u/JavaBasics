Hiding internal implementation and  just highlighting some essentials information/service is the concept of  Abstraction. Interface in java is an example of abstraction.
Abstraction is achieved using interface and GUI screens.
Ex: ATM service(cash deposit and withdraw, account balance check, ATM pin change etc. services are example of abstraction).
