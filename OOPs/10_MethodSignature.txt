Method signature contains method name followed by arguments

Method Declaration : public int m1(int I, float f) 
Signature in java :  m1(int , float)

Compiler maintains a table for every class called as Method Table.

Class A
{
	Public int m1(int x) {}
	Public double m2(double y) {}
}

Class A
Method m1(int)
Method m2(double)
Method Table

In method table, java maintains  Method table signature, and if we pass illegal arguments in any existing method ,we will  get CE error saying cannot find symbol.

NOTE: In a class there cannot be 2 methods with same signature even though the return types are different for both methods, whether we are calling or not. We will get compile time error saying : error: method m1(int) is already defined in class class_name.
