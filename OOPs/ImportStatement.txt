If we do not import class of other package and try to use it, we get compile time error : cannot find symbol

We can use fully qualified name to import - > Readability of the code will be down and length of the code will increase.

To avoid this we use import  statement
Import statement  directly import classes from given packages and we can use short names.

There are 2 types of import statement:

1.Explicit import : import java.util.ArrayList ;
2.Implicit import : import javzÌ„a.util.* ; 

NOTE: It is recommended to use  Explicit import , readability of the code will be increased.
All IDE always generate Explicit import statements

Some package need  not  to be imported, by default they are available.
Ex: java.lang package -> String class
Ex: default package -> current working directory 

Note: Whenever we import a package all the available  classes and interface are by default imported but not the sub-packages classes
